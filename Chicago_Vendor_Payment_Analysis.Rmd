# Chicago Employee Analysis

```{r}

#read data
VendorPayments <- read_rds("./input/source/vendor payments/Vendor Payments.Rds")
```

## Total Budget

```{r}
# calculate the total budget by year

VendorPayments%>% 
  mutate(Month = month(`CHECK DATE`),
         Year = year(`CHECK DATE`)) %>% 
  filter(Year == 2018) %>% 
  group_by(Year,Month) %>% 
  summarize(Count = n(), Amount = sum(AMOUNT)/100000000) %>% 
ggplot(aes(Month, Amount, size = Count)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = c(25000,50000,100000,200000)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +
  labs(title = "City of Chicago Vendor Payments", subtitle = "Year 2018", x = "Month", y = "Total Spend (in $100M)", size = "# of transactions")
```

```{r}
VendorPayments%>% 
  mutate(Month = month(`CHECK DATE`),
         Year = year(`CHECK DATE`)) %>% 
  filter(Year == 2018) %>% 
  group_by(Year,Month) %>% 
  summarize(Count = n(), Amount = sum(AMOUNT), Average = mean(AMOUNT))  %>% 
  arrange(-Average)
```



## Top Departments
By addind up the budgets for all of the years in our dataset, by department, we can see which departments have had the largest vendor payments

```{r}
# total budget by department
TopDepartments <- VendorPayments %>%
  filter(`DEPARTMENT NAME` != "NA") %>% 
  group_by(Department = `DEPARTMENT NAME`) %>% 
  summarize(Amount = sum(AMOUNT)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Amount)) %>%
  head(12) %>% 
  mutate(Amount = Amount/1000000000)

TopDepartments %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Department,Amount),Amount, fill = as.factor(Amount))) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top Vendor Payments", subtitle = "by Department", x= "",y = "$(in billions)")
```

Then we can dive deeper into the top 10 departments to see how their budgets have changed over time.

```{r}
VendorPayments %>% 
  filter(VendorPayments$`DEPARTMENT NAME` %in% TopDepartments$Department) %>% 
  filter(`DEPARTMENT NAME` != "NA") %>% 
  filter(year(`CHECK DATE`) == 2018) %>% 
  group_by(Department = `DEPARTMENT NAME`, Month = month(`CHECK DATE`)) %>% 

summarise(Amount = sum(AMOUNT)) %>% 
  mutate(Amount = Amount/1000000) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(Month,Amount)) +
    geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(3,6,9,12)) +
  facet_wrap(~Department, scales = "free") +
    labs(title = "Vendor Payments", subtitle = "by Department",caption = "City of Chicago, 2018", x= "",y="$(in millions)")
  
```

## Top Paid Vendors

```{r}
# total budget by department
VendorPayments %>%
  filter(year(`CHECK DATE`) == 2018) %>% 
group_by(`VENDOR NAME`) %>% 
  summarize(Count = n(), Amount = sum(AMOUNT), Average = mean(AMOUNT)) %>% 
  arrange(-Average) %>% 
  head(20)

```
