# Chicago Employee Analysis

```{r}

#read data
Employee <- read_rds("./input/source/employees/Current_Employee_Names__Salaries__and_Position_Titles.csv")
```

## Total Budget

```{r}
# calculate the total budget by year
Employee %>%
  filter(`Annual Salary` > 0) %>% 
  select(Name,`Job Titles`,Department, `Annual Salary`) %>% 
  arrange(-`Annual Salary`)
```

## Top Departments
By addind up the budgets for all of the years in our dataset, by department, we can see which departments have had the largest budgets.

```{r}
# total budget by department
TopDepartments <- budget %>%
  group_by(Department = `DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION`) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(`TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(10) %>% 
  mutate(total = total/1000000000)

TopDepartments %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Department,total),total, fill = as.factor(total))) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top Departments", subtitle = "Total Budget Amounts 2011-2019", x= "",y="$(in billions)")
```

Then we can dive deeper into the top 10 departments to see how their budgets have changed over time.

```{r}
budget[budget$`DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION` %in% TopDepartments$Department,] %>% 
  
  group_by(Department = `DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION`,YEAR) %>% 
summarise(total = sum(`TOTAL BUDGETED AMOUNT`)) %>% 
  mutate(total = total/1000000) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(YEAR,total)) +
    geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Department, scales = "free") +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2011,2019)) +
    labs(title = "Top Department Budgets Over time", subtitle = "Chicago Budget Data 2011-2019", x= "",y="$(in millions)")
  
```

## Top Paying Jobs

```{r}
# total budget by department
budget %>%
  select(`TITLE DESCRIPTION`,`BUDGETED PAY RATE`, `DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION`,`DIVISION DESCRIPTION`,`SECTION DESCRIPTION`,`SUB-SECTION DESCRIPTION`,YEAR) %>% 
  arrange(-`BUDGETED PAY RATE`)
```
